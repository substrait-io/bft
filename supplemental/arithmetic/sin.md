# Sin

## Options

### Rounding

Sine of an input can yield a result that is not exactly
representable in the given type class. In this case the value will be rounded.
Rounding behaviors are defined as part of the IEEE 754 standard.

#### TIE_TO_EVEN

/[%Rounding$TIE_TO_EVEN%]

#### TIE_AWAY_FROM_ZERO

/[%Rounding$TIE_AWAY_FROM_ZERO%]

#### TRUNCATE

/[%Rounding$TRUNCATE%]

#### CEILING

/[%Rounding$CEILING%]

#### FLOOR

/[%Rounding$FLOOR%]

## Details

### Other floating point exceptions

The IEEE 754 standard defines a number of exceptions beyond rounding. For
example, division by zero, overflow, and underflow. However, these exceptions
have default behaviors defined by IEEE 754 and, since no known engine deviates
from these default values, these exceptions are not exposed as options. For more
information on what happens in these cases refer to the IEEE 754 standard.

### Numerical Precision

The precision of the sin function depends on the architecture in various dialects.

### Output Range

Being a sinusoidal trigonometric function, the output of the sin function is restricted to [-1,1].
