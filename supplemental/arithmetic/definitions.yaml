Overflow:
  SILENT: >
    If an overflow occurs then an integer value will be returned. The value is
    undefined. It may be any integer and can change from engine to engine or
    even from row to row within the same query.  The only constraint is that it
    must be a valid value for the result type class.

  SATURATE: >
    If an overflow occurs then the largest (for positive overflow) or smallest
    (for negative overflow) possible value for the type class will be returned.

  ERROR: >
    If an overflow occurs then an error should be raised.

Rounding:
  TIE_TO_EVEN: >
    Round to the nearest value. If the number is exactly halfway between two
    values then round to the number whose least significant digit is even. Or,
    because we are working with binary digits, round to the number whose last digit
    is 0. This is the default behavior in many systems because it helps to avoid
    bias in rounding.

  TIE_AWAY_FROM_ZERO: >
    Round to the nearest value. If the number is exactly halfway between two values
    then round to the number furthest from zero.

  TRUNCATE: >
    Round to the nearest value. If the number is exactly halfway between two values
    then round to the value closest to zero.

  CEILING: >
    Round to the value closest to positive infinity.

  FLOOR: >
    Round to the value closest to negative infinity.

Properties:
  Null_propagating: >
    If any of the inputs is null then the output will be null

  NaN_propagating: >
    If any of the inputs is NaN (and the other input is not null) then the output
    will be NaN

  Stateless: >
    The output will be the same regardless of the order of input rows.

On_domain_error:
  NAN: >
    Return a Not a Number value if any or all of the input values are either 0 or ±infinity.
  ERROR: >
    If any or all of the input values are either 0 or ±infinity an error should be raised.
